# Migrating from Pizzly V0.2

Last update: 29th Nov 2022

The current version on the master branch is a rewrite of Pizzly to modernize it and improve development speed.

Whilst Pizzly is rapidly getting better it is not yet at feature parity with v0.2.2 yet (especially the proxy is missing, we are on it!).

If you are a current v0.2.x user please join us on the [Slack community](https://nango.dev/slack) where we share the latest updates in a Pizzly channel.
